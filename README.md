# JavaScript Interpreter in Java

This project is a Java-based interpreter for a subset of the JavaScript language. It parses, interprets, and evaluates expressions, statements, and constructs commonly found in JavaScript, like variables, functions, classes, arrays, and logical/conditional operators. This interpreter is built with concepts like Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), recursive descent parsing, and semantic analysis, focusing on JavaScript-like runtime behavior.

## Features

- **Arithmetic and Logical Operators**: Supports arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`), comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`), equality checks (`==`, `!=`), logical operations (`&&`, `||`), and assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `|=`, etc);
- **Variable Management**: Handles variable declarations, assignments, and lookups.
- **Control Structures**: Includes support for `if` statements and `while` loops.
- **Function and Class Definitions**: Supports JavaScript-like functions and class definitions.
- **Error Handling**: Implements custom error handling to provide informative messages.
- **Support for Arrays**: Allows the use of array literals, supporting elements separated by commas.


### How to Run

- Java 11 or higher installed on your machine.
- (Optional) A Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse..



**Clone the Repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/haorangan/JavaScript_Interpreter


If using command line: `javac src/myJSInterpreter/*.java`

Or using a Java IDE, run the JS file with the path as the parameter to the main method.
